## Project Snapshot

Todo Buckets is an opinionated Todo App that uses time-based buckets (e.g. This Year, This Month, This Week, Today) to manage your todos (Kanban style, todos should flow from bigger sized buckets to smaller ones).
This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Larger maintainability proposals are welcome when justified.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Maintainability

## Tech Stack

The current stack is:

- TanStack Start is the base as a full-stack React framework;
- React compiler enabled;
- TanStack Query for data fetching;
- TanStack Form for forms;
- Better Auth for authentication;
- Zod for validation;
- Drizzle as a DB ORM (using a Neon backend)
- Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui for CSS and UI components (prefer a shadcn/ui component, if available, over creating your own)

For the TanStack libraries, you have access to the TanStack CLI and you can query docs using that:
`tanstack search-docs <query> [options]`

```txt
Options:
  --library <id>       Filter by library ID
  --framework <name>   Filter by framework
  --limit <n>          Max results (default 10, max 50)
  --json               Output machine-readable JSON
```

For the rest you can search online when needed.
If you think to add a library to the project ALWAYS ASK FOR APPROVAL first and add it to this list with a few words explaining what it does.
If some library gets a major update or is removed from the project update the tech stack list above.

## Project Structure

The project has an opinionated structure that is feature-based but does not colocate client code with server code for the same feature. Client code should only import server code from `server/functions`. Some examples of important folders:

- `routes/` TanStack Start / Router routes;
- `lib/` Shared code between client and server;
- `features/` Client-side features;
- `features/shared` Features shared code (custom components, shadcn/ui components, hooks, utils etc.);
- `features/featureX` All the files related to a feature, organized in sub folders if needed, for example `/components`, `/hooks`, `/queries`, `lib` (for pure logic), `types` etc;
- `server/` all server code; client code should only import from `server/functions`;
- `server/db` DB schemas, migration and configuration;
- `server/functions` Server functions, organized in features files or sub folders when the single file gets too big;
- `server/middleware`;

As this is a WIP project this project structure is subject to changes.
When folders contain code that is exported for other modules/components an `index.ts` file should be added to improve dev experience.

## Task Readiness For Code Changes

- `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run format` and `pnpm test` must pass before considering code changes completed.
- When implementing a ticket execute a CodeRabbit review (use your skill and run commands outside the sandbox) on the uncommitted code and comments must be addressed. In case the user is asking follow up changes ask if you should run CodeRabbit or not. If running the CLI fails explain why.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked as local markdown files under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

This repo uses the default mattpocock/skills triage label vocabulary. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This repo uses a single-context domain docs layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
